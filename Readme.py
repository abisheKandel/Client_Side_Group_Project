# HealthCare+ — Client-Side Development Project

This repository contains our group project for the Client-Side Development module.  
The project involves creating a functional front-end prototype of a simple healthcare support website. It focuses on client-side features and demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used to build an interactive user experience.

## Project Description

HealthCare+ is a prototype designed to show how a basic healthcare support platform could work on the client side.  
The system includes:

- An appointment booking demonstration using LocalStorage.  
- Informational pages describing available services.  
- Supporting pages such as About and Contact for overall site structure.

The project is completely front-end based and does not use any server-side technologies.
